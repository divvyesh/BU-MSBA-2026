## ðŸŽ¯ My Story (From Colors to Code)

Growing up, I was nationally recognized as an **art prodigy ("Bala Chitra Ratna" Awardee)** by the Indian Government, deeply rooted in traditional artistry. Ironically, despite my family's background in technology Supply chain business  (Which I also oversee operations and key decisions currently), I didn't own a personal computer or phone until my undergraduate years at Christ University as my father felt technology will only ruin my Academics, but today it have never blended better for me. Initially unfamiliar with even basic tech operations, I learned quickly, leveraging online resources and peer support. My natural inclination toward creativity allowed me to rapidly master graphic design, digital storytelling, and eventually data analytics.

At Christ University, pursuing a **BBA in Business Analytics**, I led numerous initiatives including TEDx, Synergy Nature Club, Model UN, and major university events, each requiring extensive team management, data-driven strategy, and creative execution. Concurrently, I taught art to young kids internationally through LittleMaster, nurturing creativity remotely and expanding my mentoring skills.

Professionally, my tenure at **Sumedha IT** evolved from intern to Marketing & Business Development Executive, where I drove customer growth through analytics, executed strategic digital marketing initiatives, and facilitated a significant corporate acquisition by CYIENT. Then, I realised the work we do at Sumedha IT was so impactfull and with first mover advantage, Ive made a dream team to Venture into Marketing and Business Consulting through COM (Count On Me), A marketing + business consultancy for bigdogs, hustlers and underdogs. Weâ€™ve helped 25+ clients go from napkin sketch to MVPâ€”combining brand storytelling, predictive analytics, and AI prototyping.Now, as a student at **Boston University's Questrom School of Business (MS in Business Analytics)**, I'm refining my analytical and strategic skillsets under the guidance of renowned professors, while running my consultancy startup, **COM**.
